# Sample NSNSD Structure Files

------------------

This repository has pre-written structure files for a few different units. It should be enough of an example to copy and paste parts of each to assemble structure files for new datasets.

Look over the [iyore README](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/iyore#structuring) for more information about structure files and how they work.

The structure file for [Denali](DENA.txt) is also commented with examples for each Endpoint.

Note that you might want to rename each of these to `.structure.txt` if you use them, so iyore will find them automatically.
